we submitted a patch to [p2pool](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/P2Pool) to provide terracoin support.

Thanks to p2pool author, those modifications were quickly merged into [p2pool official sourcecode](https://github.com/forrestv/p2pool).

This gives you another pool-mining environment, so you can generate terracoins using a decentralized, DoS-resistant mining pool.
Our support pages should soon provide detailed instructions, until then, here's a quick [p2pool howto](/p2pool_howto.txt).
