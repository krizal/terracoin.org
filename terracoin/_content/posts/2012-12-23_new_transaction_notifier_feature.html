summary: Terracoin transaction notifier was pushed to our development branch.
---
First implementation/iteration of TerraCoin "TransactionNotifier" feature was recently pushed to the "dev-0.1.2" development branch, and a win32 binary package was uploaded to sourceforge.

Described [here](https://github.com/terracoin/terracoin/wiki/TransactionNotifier), this feature provides the terracoin application the ability to notify a remote http server of incoming transactions.

While beeing quite simple right now, this could allow merchant (or other) applications to run without the need for a local terracoin daemon, running one or more terracoin daemons at distant locations.
