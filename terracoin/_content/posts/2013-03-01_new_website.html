summary: The main project website was updated to provide more informations for a larger audience.

Previous edition of this website provided a small set of links and minimalist instructions, only suitable for intermediate and advanced users ; this new edition should fix this.

Our new website will provide more informations, targetting both new and existing terracoin users, while also providing technical informations for third-party developers or terracoin participate.

Support pages will progressively host more and more instructions, from quickstart guides to detailed technical instructions.
