This news entry was forged later (on October 6, 2013 while rewriting website), to summarize several months of network abuse and gigantic hashrate spikes.

Less than two weeks after the second alternate currencies exchange site provided TRC trading, the terracoin network ran into some serious troubles. Gigantic hashrates spikes were observed, going from twice to twenty times its nominal hashrate at this period.

Multiple attempts at tuning the difficulty retarget algorithm were made, trying to counter the effects of such sudden increase in hashrate.
In the process, a "hack" introduced to get the network of its "stuck" state was unintentionally left in the code, later leading to a big amount of terracoins collected by the attacker(s) - estimated between 120k and 150k terracoins.

On august 8th 2013, the rapid retarget algorithm was removed and a common, static retarget window was implemented, later using a shorter window (540 blocks) to limit the effects of chain hoppers joining/leaving the network collectively.
