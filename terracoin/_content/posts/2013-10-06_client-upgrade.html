summary: How to upgrade your terracoin client.
---
Terracoin installers are not distributed yet.
Windows executables are generated under linux using mingw, then uploaded to our [sourceforge project page](http://sourceforge.net/projects/terracoin/).

### Windows ###

The Terracoin client ("wallet") upgrade consists in two steps :

* downloading the latest stable terracoin archive from [sourceforge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/terracoin/files/latest/download)
* extracting this archive over your previous installation (you can use [7Zip](http://www.7-zip.org/) to extract Terracoin files from this archive).

Before proceeding, you should **backup your wallet** by copying your "wallet.dat" file to a safe place.

This file is located under the following directory:

    c:\Users\yourusername\AppData\Roaming\Terracoin



### Unix/Linux ###

No binaries are provided, you have to retrieve the latest source files and build the client locally.
You can download source tarballs or use git to retrieve or update your local copy of terracoin source files :

#### Downloading tagged releases ####

Download and extract latest release from https://github.com/terracoin/terracoin/releases

#### Alternative: downloading using git ####

Execute the following commands on your locally cloned terracoin repository :
(previously cloned using "git clone https://github.com/terracoin/terracoin.git")

    cd /path/to/your/local/clone/
    git checkout master
    git pull --tags origin master


#### Compiling your Terracoin binaries ####

build Terracoin headless daemon:

    cd src
    make clean
    nice make -f makefile.unix -j 4
    strip terracoind

build Terracoin graphical client:

    cd /path/to/your/local/clone/
    make clean
    qmake USE_IPV6=-
    nice make -j 4
    strip terracoin-qt
