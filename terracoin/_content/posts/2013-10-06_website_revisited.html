summary: terracoin.org website rewritten ; new content coming soon
---

### Motivation ###

With the goal of providing a faster way to update terracoin.org content, the website was rewritten using another cms.

This cms ([piecrust](http://bolt80.com/piecrust/)) - still acting as a static pages generator - should provides faster content publication, by the use of popular formatters (markdown, textile), without the need for any database, (fast)cgi or heavy/unsecure hosting solution.


### Theme ###

Note that current default theme is probably not the final one ; it comes from http://bootswatch.com/

Two distinct themes are actually available to you while browsing the site : use your browser's alternate stylesheet viewer to get a preview of other themes available.

If you have any suggestion or contribution to make, feel free to use our [bug tracker](https://github.com/terracoin/terracoin.org/issues).


### Terracoin documentation ###

Using categories and tags, upcoming support pages and documents should be easier to publish and browse.

"[Howto]({{ site.root }}howto.html)" section should get populated soon.
