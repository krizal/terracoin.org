The terracoin blockchain is now one year old!

Genesis block was generated on October 26th 2012, exactly one year ago.

Over the last year, multiple modifications were applied to Terracoin difficulty algorithm, while the overall network hashrate was small enough to allow manipulations from big hashpower holders.

Over the last months Terracoin network grew quite well, sustaining a more reasonable hashrate, but - which is more important - with a better decentralization due to multiple pools (including p2pool) and solo-miners.

P2pool support for Terracoin was also updated to support the most recent updates and exclude traffic from deprecated nodes.

It is now time to focus on bringing some more services and clients to the network, also updating and fixing our "SatoshiClone" qt client :

* a port of bitcoinj (java library) for terracoin is planned
* Multibit and Android-wallet clients (depending on the previous library) would then be modified to support Terracoin.
* Our qt client's portability issue should be fixed
* Recent bitcoin updates should be merged into our codebase and a new qt client released.
